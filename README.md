## About

🚧🚧🚧🚧 <br />
A WIP reverse engineered implementation of [音灵 INVAXION](https://store.steampowered.com/app/921630/_INVAXION/)'s servers, based on the client code.

If you are looking for a working solution, try out my [server emulator](https://github.com/Invaxion-Server-Emulator/invaxion-server-emulator) implemented as a client-side mod for the game.

## Technologies

Here I list some of the crates I found useful

-   tokio's [runtime](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) as well as its helpers to run a nice TCP server.
-   tokio's [prost](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost) is used to encode/decode protobuf messages.
-   [enum-repr-derive](https://github.com/ssalonen/enum-repr-derive) to encode/decode enums outside of protobuf.
-   [anyhow](https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow) to make error handling more convenient
